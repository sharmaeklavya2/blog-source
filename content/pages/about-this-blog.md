summary:


Welcome to my blog!

My primary interests are computer science, math and juggling,
so these will be the topics for most of my posts.
I'll mostly use it to publish tutorials and write about interesting life experiences.

I have generated this website using [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com).
One of the reasons for this is that Pelican is in python and I know python.
I want to explore a static site generator that I can hack apart, modify and extend.

I wrote the theme for this website myself ([github repo](https://github.com/sharmaeklavya2/MFPelicanTheme)).
It's supposed to be simple and lightweight.

I currently don't have a good system for accepting comments.
If you know a way to personally contact me, use that to give comments.
Otherwise you can [open an issue on Github](https://github.com/sharmaeklavya2/blog/issues/new) to comment.
Be sure to include the URL of the page in your comment.

To report bugs on this website,
[open an issue on my blog-source repository](https://github.com/sharmaeklavya2/blog-source/issues/new).
