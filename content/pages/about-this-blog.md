Welcome to my blog!

My primary interests are computer science, math and juggling,
so these will be the topics for most of my posts.
I'll mostly use it to publish tutorials and write about interesting life experiences.

I have generated it using [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com).
One of the reasons for this is that Pelican is in python and I know python.
I want to explore a static site generator that I can hack apart, modify and extend.

I wrote the theme for this site myself ([github repo](https://github.com/sharmaeklavya2/MFPelicanTheme)).
It's supposed to be simple and lightweight.
