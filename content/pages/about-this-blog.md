summary:


Welcome to my blog!

My primary interests are computer science, programming, math and juggling,
so these will be the topics for most of my posts.
I'll mostly use this blog to publish tutorials and write about interesting life experiences.

I generated this website using [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com)
because my familiarity with python is enough for me to modify or extend Pelican in any way I like.
I wrote the theme for this website myself ([github repo](https://github.com/sharmaeklavya2/MFPelicanTheme)).

I currently don't have a good system for accepting comments.
Either contact me personally (if you can) or
[open an issue on Github](https://github.com/sharmaeklavya2/blog/issues/new) to comment.
Be sure to include the URL of the page in your comment.
To report bugs on this website,
[open an issue on my blog-source repository](https://github.com/sharmaeklavya2/blog-source/issues/new).
