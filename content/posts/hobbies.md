summary: My hobbies, interests and preferences, along with description and references.
status: draft


Here's an attempt to exhaustively document my hobbies, interests and preferences.
In each section, things are arranged in roughly decreasing order of relevance.

Sometimes you may not know what something means exactly.
Looking it up on Wikipedia will often give you a good idea.
For things whose Wikipedia articles may not be well written,
I'll provide other references.


## Interests

* **Data Structures, Algorithms and Theoretical Computer Science**:
  For those who have no idea what the word 'Algorithm' means, look it up on the
  [simple English Wikipedia](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm).
  I started studying DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) in my first year at BITS
  so that I could become better at competitive programming.
  But in my second year I developed a liking for it by itself.

* **Competitive Programming**:
  I started solving problems on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) when I was in class 12.
  I didn't do it much then because I was also studying for engineering entrance exams.
  I solved algorithmic programming problems mostly in my first year.
  I occasionally still solve problems on [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com) and [Codeforces](http://codeforces.com).
  Although this is my favorite pastime, I didn't do it much while I was in BITS
  (compared to others in BITS) because I was busy with other things.

* **Math**: Mostly Number Theory and recently Abstract Algebra.

* **Juggling**:
  I started juggling after my entrance exams and before joining BITS.
  I know over 30 juggling patterns now. You can watch me juggle on
  [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gHr2-w0mQrk&list=PLUFqnl0Lfwwznpx15zIcBgzq4HsXLfLel).
  One of my first inspirations was this great
  [juggling video of Anthony Gatto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP8tbLBls_M).

* **Anime**:
  I have watched 'Death Note', 'Attack on Titan' and 'The Last Airbender'.
  Do not look them up on Wikipedia or something if you don't want spoilers.

* **Webcomics**:
  Webcomics are comic strips put up on websites.
  I like [XKCD](https://xkcd.com), [SMBC](https://smbc-comics.com) and [JSPH](https://www.jspowerhour.com).

* **Software development**:
  See [my Github profile](https://github.com/sharmaeklavya2) for projects I have done.
  It used to be my primary hobby in my sophomore year at BITS but I'm no longer as interested in it now.
  I still like to do it occasionally.

* **Video games**:
  I used to play a lot of video games before college
  (my favorites include Rally racing, GTA Vice City, Croc and Jazz Jackrabbit)
  but I stopped after that mostly because I have been busy and I no longer have Windows.
  Sometimes I play strategy mini-games like [Untrusted](https://alexnisnevich.github.io/untrusted/)
  and [Transcube](http://code.jerev.be/ggo13-transcube/).

* **Balancing**:
  In my third year at BITS, I learned how to balance long sticks on my foot, chin and nose.
  Here's [my video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOju-b6JRxI).

* **Cycling**:
  I love cycling as a mode of transport. I used it to commute to classes at BITS.
  I wish cycling was safer on Delhi roads. I can cycle without holding the handle.

* **Watching movies**:
  I mostly watch English movies. I don't like romantic movies.


## Dislikes

* **Tourism**

* **Attending parties, dinners, etc.**

* **Going to sleep at night and waking up in the morning**


## Preferences

* **Music**:
  I mostly like rock and some western classical.
  I also like Indian classical but good songs are harder to find in that category.
  Here are some of my favorites:

    * The Stage - Avenged Sevenfold
    * Mello theme - Death Note soundtrack
    * Hotel California - Eagles
    * [Arpeggios from Hell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B4pZBmI_gU)
    * Mr Crowley - Ozzy Osbourne
    * [Minute Waltz - Chopin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6y0eYcIJ5I)
    * [Angelina - Tommy Emmanuel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWS1IRF_IFA)
    * [Cesar Frank Sonata](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5bzrB5QbSY)
    * [Flight of the Bumblebee - Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sHURJwNjB8)
    * River flows in you - Yiruma
    * Millennium of the Blind - Megadeth

* **Food**:
  I'm vegetarian. South Indian food is my favorite.
  Very oily food makes me nauseous and some North Indian cuisines (especially that of Rajasthan) are very oily.
  I have recently developed a liking for 'oats in milk' as a quick snack.

* **Operating System**:
  I strongly prefer Linux (all distributions I have ever seen) over Windows.
  Mac is good but I find Ubuntu Linux slightly better.

* **Programming language**:
  Python is my favorite for day-to-day programming and projects.
  For competitive programming, I use C/C++. I also know Java.
  I prefer C/C++ as a first language to be taught rather than Python or Java.
  Haskell is the most elegant language I have seen,
  but I rarely use it because I find pure functional programming difficult.

* **Text editor**: Vim is my favorite. I haven't yet tried Emacs.
