summary: My hobbies, interests and preferences, along with descriptions and references.


Here's an attempt to exhaustively document my hobbies, interests and preferences.
In each section, things are arranged in roughly decreasing order of relevance.

Sometimes you may not know what something means exactly.
Looking it up on Wikipedia will often give you a good idea.
For things whose Wikipedia articles may not be well written,
I'll provide other references.

## Interests

* **Data Structures, Algorithms and Theoretical Computer Science**:
  For those who have no idea what the word 'Algorithm' means, look it up on the
  [simple English Wikipedia](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm).
  I started studying DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) in my first year at BITS
  so that I could become better at competitive programming.
  But in my second year I developed a liking for it by itself.
  In subsequent years, I studied and got interested in more areas of theoretical computer science,
  like theory of computation and computational complexity.

* **Competitive Programming**:
  I solved some math and programming problems on [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net) when I was in class 12
  and solved many algorithmic programming problems in college, mostly in my first year.
  I occasionally still solve problems on [Codechef](https://www.codechef.com/users/sharmaeklavya2)
  and [Codeforces](http://codeforces.com/profile/eku).

* **Math**: I like abstract algebra, number theory and linear algebra.
  In 2019, I began writing down some of my knowledge on my
  [theorems website](https://sharmaeklavya2.github.io/theoremdep).

* **Juggling**:
  I started juggling after my entrance exams and before joining BITS.
  I know over 30 juggling patterns now. You can watch me juggle on
  [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xYrnQMHfDNE&list=PLACN_dyOcd_WSIzGV-4hVCQyQFmzKH1kb).
  One of my first inspirations was this great
  [juggling video of Anthony Gatto](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wP8tbLBls_M).

* **Anime**:
  'Attack on Titan' is my favorite. I have also watched 'Death Note', 'Fullmetal Alchemist (Brotherhood)',
  'My Hero Academia' (first season only) and 'The Last Airbender'.
  Do not look them up on Wikipedia; you'll get spoilers.

* **Webcomics**:
  Webcomics are comic strips put up on websites.
  I like [XKCD](https://xkcd.com), [SMBC](https://smbc-comics.com) and [JSPH](https://www.jspowerhour.com).

* **Software development**:
  See [my Github profile](https://github.com/sharmaeklavya2) for projects I have done.
  It used to be my primary hobby in my sophomore year at BITS but I'm no longer as interested in it now.
  I still like to do it occasionally.

* **Watching videos on YouTube**:
  Refer to my [subscriptions](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsI0Lrna_yR_X9H5m_ubM9A/channels)
  and [liked videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=LLsI0Lrna_yR_X9H5m_ubM9A).

* **Balancing**:
  In my third year at BITS, I learned how to balance long sticks on my foot, chin and nose.
  Here's [my video on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sOju-b6JRxI).

* **Watching movies**:
  I rarely watch movies (less than once a month).
  I mostly watch English movies.
  My favorites are 'The Matrix' and 'Avatar'. I also like the Marvel movies.
  Among Indian movies, Baahubali is my favorite.

* **Video games**:
  I used to play a lot of video games before college.
  My favorites include Rally racing, GTA Vice City and 2D platform games.
  I stopped after that mostly because I have been busy and I no longer have Windows.
  Sometimes I play strategy mini-games like [Untrusted](https://alexnisnevich.github.io/untrusted/)
  and [Transcube](http://code.jerev.be/ggo13-transcube/).

* **Cycling**:
  I love cycling as a mode of transport. I used it to commute to classes at BITS.
  I wish cycling was safer on city roads in India. I can cycle without holding the handlebars.


## Dislikes

* **Tourism**

* **Attending parties, dinners, etc.**


## Preferences

* **Music**:
  I mostly like rock and some western classical.
  I also like Indian classical but good songs are harder to find in that category.
  Here are some of my favorites:

    * The Stage - Avenged Sevenfold
    * Mello theme - Death Note soundtrack
    * Hotel California - Eagles
    * [Arpeggios from Hell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B4pZBmI_gU)
    * Mr Crowley - Ozzy Osbourne
    * [Minute Waltz - Chopin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I6y0eYcIJ5I)
    * [Angelina - Tommy Emmanuel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWS1IRF_IFA)
    * [Cesar Frank Sonata](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5bzrB5QbSY)
    * [Flight of the Bumblebee - Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_sHURJwNjB8)
    * River flows in you - Yiruma
    * Millennium of the Blind - Megadeth

* **Food**:
  I'm vegetarian. South Indian food is my favorite.
  Very oily food makes me nauseous and some North Indian cuisines (especially that of Rajasthan) are very oily.
  I can also cook basic food.

* **Operating System**:
  I strongly prefer Linux (all distributions I have ever seen) and MacOS over Windows.
  My favorite thing about Linux and MacOS is that they are Unix-like OSes where
  I can use [the terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator) for most of my work.
  This might seem primitive to most people, but I think the terminal is better than graphical programs
  for a lot of tasks once you get used to it.

* **Programming language**:
  Python is my favorite for day-to-day programming and projects.
  For competitive programming, I use C/C++. I also know Java.
  I prefer C/C++ as a first language to be taught rather than Python or Java.
  Haskell is the most elegant language I have seen,
  but I rarely use it because I find pure functional programming difficult.

* **Text editor**: Vim is my favorite. I haven't yet tried Emacs.
  You can check out my [.vimrc](https://github.com/sharmaeklavya2/dotfiles/blob/master/dotfiles/.vimrc).
