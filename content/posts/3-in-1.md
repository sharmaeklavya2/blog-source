3 balls in 1 hand, a.k.a. 3-in-1, is definitely not an easy pattern,
mostly because of the speed, accuracy and strength required to pull it off.
I could learn to do it because I came up with good prerequisites.
It still took me a few months to learn it (which is much more than the average time I take to learn a pattern),
and I still haven't mastered it.

Throughout this article, I'll assume that you want to juggle 3 balls in your right hand.
If you want to juggle with your left hand, just mirror-invert all instructions here.
In all [siteswaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siteswap) mentioned here,
the first throw will be from the right hand.

First of all, you should have mastered the 3 ball shower (siteswap `51`) to almost perfection.
There are 2 mirror-images of the shower.
You must perfect the one where the left hand makes the horizontal pass
(i.e. siteswap `51`, not `15`).

Then you must learn to make a type-6 throw.
While juggling `51`, replace one of the type-5 throws by a type-6 throw.
It'll look similar to `6151505151515151`.

Practice this until you find it easy to replace a type-5 throw by a type-6 throw.

Now practice `615150`, then `6051`, then `61615050` and then `606150`.

<table>
<tr> <td>615150</td> <td>6051</td> <td>61615050</td> <td>606150</td> </tr>
<tr>
<td><img src="{filename}/img/siteswaps/615150.gif" title="615150" /></td>
<td><img src="{filename}/img/siteswaps/6051.gif" title="6051" /></td>
<td><img src="{filename}/img/siteswaps/61615050.gif" title="61615050" /></td>
<td><img src="{filename}/img/siteswaps/606150.gif" title="606150" /></td>
</tr>
</table>

You might also want to try out other variations.
After you get good at these, you can finally try 3-in-1.
