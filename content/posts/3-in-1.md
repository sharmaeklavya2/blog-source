3 balls in 1 hand, a.k.a. 3-in-1, is definitely not an easy pattern,
mostly because of the speed, accuracy and strength required to do it.
I could learn to do it because I came up with good prerequisites.
It still took me a few months to learn it and I still haven't mastered it.

Throughout this tutorial, I'll assume that you want to juggle 3 balls in your right hand.
If you want to juggle with your left hand, just mirror-invert all instructions here.
In all [siteswaps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siteswap) mentioned here,
the first throw will be from the right hand.

First of all, you should have mastered the 3 ball shower (siteswap `51`) to almost perfection.
There are 2 mirror-images of the shower.
You must perfect the one where the left hand makes the horizontal pass
(i.e. siteswap `51`, not `15`).

Then you must learn to make a type-6 throw.
While juggling `51`, replace one of the type-5 throws by a type-6 throw.
It'll look similar to `6151505151515151`.

Practice this until you find it easy to replace a type-5 throw by a type-6 throw.

Now practice `615150`, then `6051` and then `606150`.

You might also want to try out other variations.
After you get good at these, you can finally try 3-in-1.
